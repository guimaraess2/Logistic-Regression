# Logistic-Regression

Diabetes and heart disease are two of the most expensive and prevalent chronic conditions that affect patients in countries like the United States and Brazil, leading the healthcare industry to spend billions each year to treat and manage these disorders.

As care delivery continues to evolve from reactive disease treatment to preventive and proactive care, more organizations are looking to advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to help draw actionable conclusions from their big data resources.

With machine learning methods, we can process large amounts of data and examine the many factors involved in predicting a future outcome.

With machine learning algorithms, however, suppliers can design personalized interventions for each patient, from increased monitoring to modified treatment plans. These personalized efforts can help them intervene before the patient's condition reaches a critical stage, resulting in lower care costs and better health outcomes.

I used Machine Learning algorithms to do a predictive analysis of diabetes. A Kaggle database was used in which I used several different algorithms to search for the one with the best accuracy

SVM algorithm reached 66.37% accuracy.
Artificial neural networks algorithm reached 66.37% accuracy.
Decision Tree algorithm reached 73.27% accuracy.
SVM algorithm reached 66.37% accuracy.
The best result was Logistic Regression algorithm reached 80.17% accuracy.
